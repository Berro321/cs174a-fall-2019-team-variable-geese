### Overview:

### Individual Tasks:
Ben:
I contributed to this project mainly in terms of laying out the structure of the game as well as implementing a lot of the logic behind it. I implemented the movement-tile algorithm (DFS) and also took care of moving the geese around the map. I worked primarily on creating the game structure/features, the geese class structure, and how animations would be taken care of (frame based). Data structures I worked with included arrays and maps. I contributed a lot of bug fixes when integrating parts of code to the actual game itself.
